## Hi there 👋

# 📊 IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate - Journey & Portfolio

Welcome to my repository! This space serves as a live documentation of my transition into the dynamic world of **Data Analytics**. Here, I collect all labs, scripts, and projects completed during the **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate** program.

## 🚀 The Mission
Having recently earned my **Microsoft AI-900 (Azure AI Fundamentals)** certification, I am now building a deep technical foundation in Python and SQL. My goal is to combine my business background with these modern tools to translate complex data into strategic gold.

## 🛠️ Technical Ecosystem & Value Stream

> "Data is the raw material; efficiency is the refinery."

### 🏎️ The Analysis Engine (Languages & Logic)
* **Python:** Mastering the art of automation using `Pandas` and `NumPy` to transform raw data into insights.
* **SQL:** The language of precision. Querying relational databases and `IBM DB2` to extract high-value datasets from complex structures.

### 🧪 The Refining Lab (Processing & Wrangling)
* **Advanced Excel:** Utilizing `V-XLOOKUP`, `Pivot Tables`, and `Descriptive Statistics` for rapid data cleaning and ad-hoc banking reports.
* **Data Wrangling:** Expertly moving from "Data Mining" to "Data Cleaning," focusing on reducing *Muda* (waste) in the data preparation phase.

### 📊 The Presentation Suite (Visualization & BI)
* **Business Intelligence:** Crafting executive-grade dashboards with `IBM Cognos` to track and visualize critical KPIs.
* **Data Storytelling:** Using `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, and `Plotly` to create interactive "visual narratives" that drive E-commerce strategy and consumer insights.

### 🏗️ The Infrastructure (Environment & Method)
* **Tech Stack:** `Jupyter Notebooks`, `VS Code`, and `GitHub` for version-controlled, reproducible research.
* **Strategic Mindset:** Driving all projects with a **Lean Six Sigma** approach to process efficiency and a **Scrum** framework for iterative, high-value delivery.

## 📈 My Approach
I believe data is most powerful when it drives efficiency. I am **leveraging my upcoming Lean Six Sigma and Scrum mindset** to ensure that every analysis I perform isn't just accurate, but also optimizes the broader business process and delivers maximum value.
