## Hi there 👋

# 📊 IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate - Journey & Portfolio

Welcome to my repository! This space serves as a live documentation of my transition into the dynamic world of **Data Analytics**. Here, I collect all labs, scripts, and projects completed during the **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate** program.

## 🚀 The Mission
Having recently earned my **Microsoft AI-900 (Azure AI Fundamentals)** certification, I am now building a deep technical foundation in Python and SQL. My goal is to combine my business background with these modern tools to translate complex data into strategic gold.
